To use the compiler under Cygwin/Windows:

- use linux "cd" command to navigate into the folder containg the pascal2arm.exe.

- compile the files into a .exe by typing "make" into the Cygwin terminal.

- pass the pascal input file as an argument for the compiler.
	ie: ./pascal2arm.exe pascalSource.pas

- the outputted ARM code is found in output.txt.
